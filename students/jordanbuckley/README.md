My name is Jordan Buckley. I'm from Seattle but I've lived in some other places, like Maine, Alabama, Kentucky, and Scotland. 

I studied history in college, linguistics for my master's degree, and now I work as an editor for a blog. 

I really love new technologies and the web, and I've dabbled in code over the years, but now I'm working toward changing careers and getting into web/software development. I'm interested in user experience design, web applications, and Android development.
